## An Intro to REDIS:

  Redis is an open source program which is used to store the data models in the format of key-value.

### Data-types used in REDIS:

- STRINGS
- HASHES
- LISTS
- SETS
- SORTED SETS
- BITMAPS
- HYPERLOGLOGS

### The 3 main unique feature of Redis is:

  1)	It holds the database in the memory by using the disk only for persistence.
  
  2)	It contains highly rich data types when compared with many other key-value data store.
  
  3)	It helps to replicate data to any number of slaves as possible.

### ADVANTAGES:

  1)	Fast = It is very fast in which it can perform above 1,10,000 SETs per/sec and above 81,000 GETs per/sec.

  2)	Rich Data type = Support Data types like set, list, hashes, string and sorted set. 
  
  3)	Atomic = All operation in Redis are atomic, which ensures that if two clients concurrently access, Redis server will receive the updated value.
  
  4)	Multi-utility tool = It is used in many number of cases such as caching, messaging-queues, web application etc,,,
